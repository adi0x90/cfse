# CFSE Extensions

This directory contains optional extensions to the CFSE core specification.

Extensions are opt-in and MUST be declared by a corpus. See `spec/foundations/extensions.md` for the normative rules.

This public repository may include zero or more extension packages over time. Extensions can also be published separately.
